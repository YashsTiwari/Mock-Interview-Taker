        "**Question:** What is your experience with version control systems like Git?\n",
        "**User's Answer:** \"I have used Git for a few months on personal projects. I know how to commit changes, create branches, and merge them.\"\n",
        "**Feedback:** Your understanding of Git basics is a great start. However, in professional settings, it's crucial to demonstrate more in-depth knowledge and best practices.\n",
        "**Improvement Suggestions:**\n",
        "1. Discuss strategies for managing branches effectively in a team environment, such as using feature branches and maintaining a clean main branch.\n",
        "2. Mention your experience with collaborating on GitHub or GitLab, including pull requests and code reviews.\n",
        "3. Highlight familiarity with advanced features like rebasing, stashing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n",
        "---------------------\n",
        "Example 2: Interview Question\n",
        "**Question:** Can you explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
        "**User's Answer:** \"Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that uses objects and classes. It helps organize code by grouping related tasks.\"\n",
        "**Feedback:** Your answer outlines the basic structure of OOP, but it would benefit from a deeper exploration of its principles and real-world applications.\n",
        "**Improvement Suggestions:**\n",
        "1. Discuss the four main principles of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "2. Provide examples of how these principles are used in designing software.\n",
        "3. Highlight the benefits of OOP, such as code reuse and modularity.\n",

        "Example 3: Interview Question\n",
        "**Question:** How do you ensure the quality of your code?\n",

        "**Feedback:** Including unit testing and linting is an essential part of ensuring code quality, but there are additional methods you can use to enhance code reliability and maintainability.\n",
        "**Improvement Suggestions:**\n",
        "1. Mention your experience with code reviews and how they help improve code quality.\n",
        "2. Discuss other testing strategies, such as integration and end-to-end testing.\n",
        "3. Highlight the use of CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.\n",
